FRAudioSettings
===============
FRAudioSettings is a (slightly old) Python-based Front-Row plugin that allows one to control Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil software via the Front-Row interface. Airfoil streams your computer's audio output to Airport Express base stations, or other computers running Rogue Amoeba's client software. This plugin makes having a large number of Airport Express base-stations just slightly more convenient.

Additionally, I hope that it will also be a useful jumping-off point for those of you in the mood to extend Front Row with Python.

Getting Started (Theoretically)
-------------------------------
Ensure that you've installed Apple's developer tools (if you haven't, you've got bigger fish to fry). Then, simply:

    sudo make install

and run Front Row. There should be a new menu item on the list called AudioSettings.

I make no claim that this code will work -- just a heads up. It's kind of old, and I just wanted to share it.

As always, happy hunting.
